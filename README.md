📌 Objective
Build a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The goal is to enhance fundamental web development skills and understand how front-end logic and UI work together.

🛠️ Tech Stack Used
1. HTML5 – Structure of the calculator.
2. CSS3 – Styling and layout of the calculator.
3. JavaScript – Functional logic for arithmetic operations and button handling.

📋 Features
1. Responsive and clean user interface.
2. Real-time input display.
3. Functional buttons for:
       Addition (+),
       Subtraction (-),
       Multiplication (×),
       Division (÷),
       Clear (C),
       Backspace (←),
       Result (=).

4. Error handling for invalid inputs.

🎯 Outcome
A fully functional, visually appealing calculator that mimics the behavior of a standard handheld calculator, built entirely using front-end technologies.
